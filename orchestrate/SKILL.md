name: orchestrate
description: Ledger-based orchestration for multi-batch code changes. Scaffolds and drives file-based ledgers in .agents/changes/ — locked plan with a wave map (file-disjoint batches run concurrently, one git branch per batch, worktree implementers), a mechanical fence check plus an independent hunk-to-finding reviewer gate per batch, validation on the integration tip after every merge, user smoke tests only at planned checkpoints (after hands-on-risk waves plus one final — never per batch by default), and crash-safe PROGRESS reconciliation where git is truth. Use when the user asks to plan or orchestrate a multi-item or multi-batch change as a ledger; says "continue", "resume the batch work", asks for ledger status, or gives a smoke-test verdict in a repo that has a .agents/changes/ directory; or asks to set a repo up for ledger-driven orchestration. Modes: new <description> | continue | status | close.

# Ledger orchestration

Multi-batch changes run from a **ledger**: a committed directory
`.agents/changes/<PREFIX>-YYYYMMDD-<slug>/` holding the user's verbatim request, a
locked plan with a wave map and smoke checkpoints, one file per batch, a binding
contract (`00-READBEFORE.md`), a live `PROGRESS.md` where statuses are claims and
**git is truth**, and an append-only `LOG.md` for narrative. Ledgers are CLOSED SYSTEMS:
every repo fact is baked in at scaffold time, so any session — with or without this
skill — can drive one by reading the ledger alone. Full spec:
[references/protocol.md](references/protocol.md).

**Arguments**: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Mode dispatch

First word of the arguments:

- `new <description>` → scaffold a ledger
- `continue` → run the session algorithm on the active ledger
- `status` → read-only reconcile + report
- `close` → process smoke verdicts / finish the change
- empty or anything else → run Discovery, then route by message shape: a smoke verdict
  ("passed", "X is broken") → `close`; "what's left / where are we" → `status`;
  "continue / resume / next batch" → `continue`; a new multi-item request → confirm the
  scope, then `new`. Ambiguous → ask.

## Discovery (every mode starts here)

Use `node orchestrate/tools/git-evidence.mjs discovery --repo <repo>` for the
repeatable read-only inventory and provenance probes; helper recipes and manual
fallback are in protocol.md. Inspect completeness/diagnostics; unknown never means
absent. The rules below still decide ownership, targets and ledger state. Existing
ledgers keep their frozen contract and gates even when this skill changes.

1. Find ledgers in the WORKING TREE: glob `**/PROGRESS.md` rooted at
   `<repo>/.agents/changes/` — dot-dirs often escape repo-root globs, so root the search
   INSIDE the directory; if that still returns nothing, list the directory directly. A
   repo may park closed ledgers in a sibling archive dir (e.g. `.agents/archive/`) OUTSIDE
   this root — that is the point of it; never widen the glob to sweep them back in. An
   empty ledger directory is ignored.
2. Find ledgers that exist only on BRANCHES — scaffold commits live on the integration
   branch, never on the default branch, so a checkout on `main` may show none of the
   active work. Enumerate ALL local and remote-tracking branches with
   `git for-each-ref --format='%(refname) %(symref)' refs/heads/ refs/remotes/`.
   Skip ONLY symbolic refs (a nonempty `symref`, e.g. `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`). For
   EVERY remaining ref, run `git ls-tree -r --name-only <ref> -- .agents/changes/` and find
   its `PROGRESS.md` files. Branch names never gate this probe: conventional
   `chore/<slug>-ledger`, shallow `foo-ledger`, and custom names are all candidates,
   even when another branch has already yielded a ledger. Skip ids under
   `.agents/archive/`. Use full refs for Git reads to avoid local/remote name collisions.
   There is no default-branch or ancestry pre-filter: even a merged ref can carry an
   unfinished ledger. Group copies of the same ledger id across the checkout and refs;
   list their branch locations together, not as separate active changes. Read only
   each candidate's contract fields needed for ownership and merge targets (legacy
   equivalents per protocol.md).
   Read branch files with `git show <ref>:./<path>` (keep the `./`; run from the repo
   root). Compare LEDGER versions, not whole branch tips: obtain the last ledger-changing
   commit with `git log -1 --format=%H <ref> -- .agents/changes/<id>/`. Its ledger-subtree
   tree id must equal the candidate ref's tree id at that path (use `git rev-parse
   <ref>:./.agents/changes/<id>` for each). That commit being an ancestor of the
   owning integration tip or resolved shipment target proves the committed copy is
   older there; unrelated later branch commits do not invalidate that proof. Unknown
   provenance, newer/conflicting ledger commits, or uncommitted ledger edits in an
   associated worktree remain visible, never silently superseded.
   Resolve ownership first: use the declared integration branch's current contract.
   A recorded target correction there supersedes proven older ledger copies; their
   old target values do not create a new ambiguity. Unresolved ownership or target
   conflicts, divergent local/remote integration refs, or conflicting working-tree
   ledger edits are AMBIGUOUS.
   Resolve the owning contract's shipment target per its §Recovery, then inspect only
   this candidate's id there: an explicit COMPLETE marker in `.agents/changes/<id>/`
   or its presence in `.agents/archive/<id>/` supersedes proven older ledger copies.
   If the integration branch was deleted, use the candidate's recorded target for
   this check; a missing owner alone cannot resurrect a proven completed/archive copy.
   Ancestry alone never establishes COMPLETE or archived. Missing target evidence
   leaves the candidate visible; it cannot justify dropping it or inferring shipment.
   Reconcile active work only under its owning contract.
   Report branch-only ledgers with their classified state and "on <branch>; checkout
   is on <current>".
   Never switch the main checkout and never copy ledger files into another branch's tree.
3. Classify by GREP, never by reading the file. First the preamble's `**State**:` line
   (`ACTIVE | AT-CHECKPOINT C<n> | USER-BLOCKED | COMPLETE`); ledgers without one (older
   scaffolds) are classified from their BATCHES-TABLE rows plus the Session log — never
   from the Legend line or log prose (both quote every emoji). A closed ledger's log
   runs to tens of thousands of characters; read the BODY of at most the ONE ledger you
   are about to act on.
   - **COMPLETE**: State says so, or the Session log (or verdict log) carries an explicit
     change-COMPLETE marker — even if advisory `👤` rows remain (surface those as
     reminders).
   - **ACTIVE**: State ACTIVE / AT-CHECKPOINT, or any batch row ⬜ 🔄 🟢 🧪 ❌ ⛔ with no
     COMPLETE marker.
   - **USER-BLOCKED**: only `👤` rows remain open — report what the user must do;
     there is nothing for the orchestrator.
   - **AMBIGUOUS** → ask.
4. COMPLETE ledgers are NEVER resumed. If the user says "continue" and nothing is
   active: reconcile, report completion, point at the backlog. Do not fabricate a batch.
5. Multiple ACTIVE ledgers → list them one line each; the user picks.
6. Legacy ledgers (older file names / status vocabularies / per-batch smoke gates / no
   State line) are driven under their OWN contract — see protocol.md §Legacy ledger
   recognition. Never rewrite one, never add the new gates to one.

## Invariants (binding in every mode)

- Statuses are claims; **git is truth** — reconcile before believing any PROGRESS row.
  The orchestrator never switches the main checkout: it reads with `git show` and writes
  through an integration worktree under the session scratchpad.
- One branch per batch, cut from the integration branch when its wave opens. Never
  commit to the default branch, never push. The orchestrator merges REVIEWED batches
  into the integration branch; anything merges toward the default branch only per the
  ledger's merge policy or the user's explicit words in THIS session.
- Only batches the plan marked mutually file-disjoint and dependency-free share a
  wave; the user's plan approval is the standing authorization for that concurrency.
  Deviating from the locked wave map needs the user's explicit words, recorded
  verbatim in PROGRESS (sole standing exception: a recorded `NEEDS_FENCE` deferral
  moving the final checkpoint). A mid-wave fence extension is allowed only when it keeps the
  wave disjoint (protocol §Fence changes) and is recorded in PROGRESS.
- The wave-open PROGRESS commit on the integration branch (member rows → 🔄, wave base
  SHA logged, State line) is the crash marker reconciliation keys on.
- Every `continue` begins with validation on the integration tip; a red tip is repaired
  before any wave opens (unless a capped tip repair is awaiting the user's verdict — then
  ask, never re-spawn).
- Smoke gates are planned CHECKPOINTS — after waves carrying hands-on risk, plus one
  mandatory final — never per batch by default. A reached checkpoint belongs to the
  USER: never flip ✅ without their verdict; never open the next wave past an
  unanswered 🧪. Agent-runnable steps are pre-verified by a QA runner before the
  hand-over; `❌` is written only when the USER fails a reached checkpoint.
- Implementer sub-agents never touch version files, the changelog, PROGRESS or LOG, and
  never spawn gate agents. Sub-agent reports are structured and capped; the orchestrator
  acts on nothing without the status line and evidence block.
- Every batch passes, in order: a MECHANICAL fence check (paths, both rename endpoints,
  clean worktree — fence bounces are not review rounds), the failing-on-base check for
  `fix` batches, then ONE fresh independent read-only reviewer (plus any gate agents the
  contract names, in parallel) that maps every diff hunk to a batch item; unmapped hunks
  are scope creep and reject the round. P0/P1 block; ASKs close as a polish pass. Two
  `FIX FIRST` rounds max, then ⛔ (defective, or green with a residual) and the STOP
  offers the user: fix again / ship with the residual / drop.
- Integration is per batch: merge-tree dry run → merge → validation on the integration
  tip → 🟢. Every repair is a reviewed mini-batch on its own branch — never a direct
  commit on the integration branch.
- Default session cadence: run autonomously to the next checkpoint — waves in
  sequence, no stopping between batches — halting early only at ⛔ or an unplanned
  user gate.
- No `--no-verify`, no force-push, no history rewriting.
- The ledger's own contract outranks this skill's reference docs.

## Evidence and smoke-input responsibilities

After the implementer report, use the read-only `check-fence.mjs` mechanical gate
before fresh semantic review when the ledger's own contract enables it (commands,
authority grammar and manual fallback in protocol.md). PASS does not grant scope or
approve a merge; UNKNOWN never passes. Capture both refs/SHAs and both diagnostic
arrays. Continue to map every hunk independently under the same cap and verdict rules.

At planning and checkpoint close-out, the conductor inventories, generates,
independently validates and delivers actual reproducible inputs per smoke step.
Supply workbooks with specified sheets/types/formulas/edge cases, exact file links,
expected results and working-copy/reset instructions; preserve immutable versioned
inputs/evidence. Name specific private-data/credential/access prerequisites instead
of fake files or pre-verification. No manual construction unless that is the test.
Compare resolved input identities on reissue and bump EVERY affected step revision;
use the input registry and raw-file/history checks in references/smoke-page.md.
Ordinary synthetic preparation adds no user gate.

## Mode: new

Read [references/scaffolding.md](references/scaffolding.md) and the files in
[templates/](templates/), then: preconditions (git repo; tree state) → detect repo
facts (validation commands and their quiet form, versioning, gate agents, runners,
backlog id scheme) → ONE consolidated interview round → plan the batches (explore; batch
table with weights and file fences; item→batch coverage) → structure for throughput per
[references/execution-models.md](references/execution-models.md): reshape fences for
disjointness, build the wave map (widest safe waves), classify each batch hands-on vs
machine-verifiable and each smoke step `Runner: agent | human`, place the smoke
checkpoints (fewest possible — hands-on waves + one final) → backlog sweep (propose
eligible fold-ins per scaffolding.md; the user picks at plan approval) → independent
plan PRE-FLIGHT (a fresh read-only sub-agent; blocking findings fixed before the user
sees the plan) → front-load user gates (design/UX approvals resolved at planning time
via mockups, or scheduled as wave 1 — never mid-run) → user approves plan + wave map +
checkpoints + fold-ins in one pass → fill the templates into
`.agents/changes/<CHANGE_ID>/` (incl. `LOG.md`) → self-check (grep the new directory
for `{{` and `<!--`, and its `*.md` for `<title>` — zero hits; `**State**: ACTIVE` present;
every `#` cell of the plan's and PROGRESS's batch tables reads `Bnn`) → scaffold commit on
`chore/<slug>-ledger` (which becomes the integration branch) → STOP and report.

## Mode: continue

1. Discovery → exactly one ACTIVE ledger (else ask).
2. Read the ledger's OWN contract (`00-READBEFORE.md`; legacy names per protocol.md;
   contract absent → protocol.md fills the gaps, ask before acting on ambiguity).
3. Boot + reconcile + resume-time validation per the contract, then run its §Session
   algorithm: repairs (❌ / red tip) first as mini-batches → unanswered 🧪 checkpoint →
   open the next wave (cut branches + worktrees, spawn ALL of the wave's implementers
   concurrently) → per batch as each lands: fence check → failing-on-base → reviewer +
   gate agents → polish / fix rounds → integrate (dry run, merge, tip validation) →
   next wave, repeating until a checkpoint → per-checkpoint close-out (tip validation,
   QA-runner pre-smoke with evidence, page) → STOP, delivering the checkpoint's combined
   smoke script as an interactive smoke page per
   [references/smoke-page.md](references/smoke-page.md) using available HTML delivery
   tools, or the full plain-text script when no usable HTML delivery is available.
   Build spawn prompts from
   [references/subagent-prompts.md](references/subagent-prompts.md).

## Mode: status

Strictly read-only (no edits, no branch changes, no checkout switch): discovery →
reconcile every row that is not ✅/👤/⛔ (dropped) against git per the contract's §Recovery table → print a
claim-vs-git-vs-verdict table, the checkpoint(s) awaiting the user, branch-only ledgers,
and the recommended next action. Drift corrections happen in `continue`, not here.

## Mode: close

1. Record the user's verdict VERBATIM in the PROGRESS smoke-verdict log. A checkpoint
   pass flips every batch it covers 🧪→✅. A fail: triage the symptoms to the
   offending batch(es) → ❌ and write `fix-up pending: fix/<batch>-c<n>-followup[-<k>]` to
   each indicted row's Notes, suffixing when the name exists (the fix-up mini-batch then
   runs via `continue`; a row whose earlier fix-up is still unmerged gets no second line —
   the new report rides that fix-up as additional failure notes); batches the
   user explicitly passed flip ✅; the rest stay 🧪 for the re-run. Smoke-page verdicts
   beyond pass/fail ([references/smoke-page.md](references/smoke-page.md)):
   **works-but** → named backlog entry, never a failure; **blocked** → correct the
   step and re-issue the page, or reclassify as a fail if the app lacks the behavior.
2. Merge / push / release ONLY on the user's explicit authorization — their exact words
   are the record (a verdict message may carry the authorization; quote it). Verdicts on
   a ⛔ batch or a capped repair (fix again / ship with the residual / drop) are recorded
   the same way, verbatim, in the verdict log (Checkpoint column = `B<NN>`), and consumed
   by `continue`.
3. Final checkpoint ✅ → change-complete close-out per the contract: convergence pass
   (when the contract turns it on, a fresh read-only sub-agent classifies every item
   against the tip; otherwise the audit comes from PROGRESS + git and says so), final coverage
   audit (zero unaccounted items; fold-ins removed from the backlog), distillation (new
   bug classes → one-line guardrails with pointers; propose retirements past the size
   threshold, never delete unasked; harvest LOG.md learnings), optional release command,
   session-log row marked COMPLETE + `**State**: COMPLETE`, propose deleting merged
   branches and archiving the ledger.

## Refusals

- Not a git repo → do not scaffold; offer `git init` and wait for consent.
- Asked to resume a COMPLETE ledger → reconcile, report completion, point at the
  backlog.
- Contract absent and the legacy shape ambiguous → ask; never guess a protocol.
- Asked to skip the fence check, the reviewer gate or a reached checkpoint → only with
  the user's explicit waiver, recorded verbatim in PROGRESS.
